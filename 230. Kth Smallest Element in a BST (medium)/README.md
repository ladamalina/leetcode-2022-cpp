# Leetcode / 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is n.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
