# Leetcode / 61. Rotate List (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9`
