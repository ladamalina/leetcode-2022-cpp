[https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`
