# Leetcode / 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
