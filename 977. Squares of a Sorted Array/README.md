# Leetcode / 977. Squares of a Sorted Array (easy) using C++

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
