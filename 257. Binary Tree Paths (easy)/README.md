# Leetcode / 257. Binary Tree Paths (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
