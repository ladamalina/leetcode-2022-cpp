# Leetcode / 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- nums is a non-decreasing array.
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
