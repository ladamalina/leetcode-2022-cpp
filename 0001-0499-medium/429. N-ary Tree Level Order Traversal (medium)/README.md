# Leetcode / 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Constraints:

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000
- The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`
