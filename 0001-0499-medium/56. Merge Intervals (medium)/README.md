[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Constraints:

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`
