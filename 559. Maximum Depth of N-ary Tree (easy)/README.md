# Leetcode / 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/)

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Constraints:

- The total number of nodes is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
-
