# Leetcode / 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
