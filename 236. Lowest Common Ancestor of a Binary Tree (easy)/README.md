# Leetcode / 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All Node.val are unique.
- `p != q`
- p and q will exist in the tree.
