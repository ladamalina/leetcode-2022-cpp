# Leetcode / 606. Construct String from Binary Tree (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
```

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```
