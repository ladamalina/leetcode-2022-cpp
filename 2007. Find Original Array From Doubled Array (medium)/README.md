# Leetcode / 2007. Find Original Array From Doubled Array (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/)

An integer array original is transformed into a doubled array changed by appending twice the value of every element in original, and then randomly shuffling the resulting array.

Given an array changed, return original if changed is a doubled array. If changed is not a doubled array, return an empty array. The elements in original may be returned in any order.

Constraints:

- `1 <= changed.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= changed[i] <= 10^5`
