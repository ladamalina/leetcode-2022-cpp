# Leetcode / 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in head is in the range `[0, 2 * 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
