# Leetcode / 136. Single Number (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
