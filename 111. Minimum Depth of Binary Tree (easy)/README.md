# Leetcode / 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^5]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
