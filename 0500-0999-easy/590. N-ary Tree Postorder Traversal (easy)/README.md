# Leetcode / 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal (easy) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
