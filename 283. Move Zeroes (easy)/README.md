# Leetcode / 283. Move Zeroes (easy) using C++

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
