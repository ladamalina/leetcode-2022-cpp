# Leetcode / 347. Top K Frequent Elements (medium) using C++

[https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- k is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.
